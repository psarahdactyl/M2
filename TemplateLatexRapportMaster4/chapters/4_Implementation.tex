\chapter{Implementing a Character Connection Algorithm}


\section{Interface}


\section{Intelligently Connecting Rigs}
Rather than changing the whole LOA concept and optimization algorithm, we reduce the more complex problem of using LOAs on multiple characters to the original LOA problem and utilize (nearly) the exact same minimization.

\section{Challenges}


\section{User Constraints}
Only allowed to connect and disconnect skeletons at keyframes.
