\section{Our Solution}

\subsection{Experiment}
Describe the performance metrics, experimental hypotheses, experimental conditions, test data,
and expected results. Provide the test data. Interpret the results of the experiments. Pay special
attention to cases where the experiments give no information or did not come out as expected.
Draw lessons and conclusions from the experiments. Explain how additional experiments could
validate or confirm results.
